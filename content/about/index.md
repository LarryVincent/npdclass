This is a companion site to [Larry Vincent's](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/laurence-vincent) MBA course on New Product Development. It is primarily intended as a resource for students and alumni, but it contains information and resources that may be useful to anyone who shares an interest in the marketing perspective of product development.

### How to use this site

The **Sessions** section is directly tied to the course's thirteen chapters. Here you will find contextual insights and supplementary material. If you are currently taking the course, the session guides are updated throughout the semester with new information that surfaces through the news and class discussions.

The **Blog** section is a continuous feed of news, resources and information that I share for your consideration. It also contains some of my thoughts and writings on relevant product development topics.
